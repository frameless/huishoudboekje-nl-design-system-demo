# Some clarification on terminology:
# BE = Backend (The API)
# FE = Frontend (The UI)
# (BE|FE)-(D|T|A|P)
#
# We use a DTAP setup (Develop, Test, Acceptance, Production)
# where FE-D runs locally but talks BE-T. FE-T, FE-A and FE-P are talking to to BE-T, BE-A and BE-P respectively.
# Hence we only need a pipeline for T, A and P, not for D.
